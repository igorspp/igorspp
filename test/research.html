          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>Microorganisms are directly and indirectly involved with every aspect of our lives, from the oxygen that we breath to the food that we eat. Considering their importance, one might be surprised to learn that only a small fraction (around 5%) of the microbial diversity that exists in our planet has been studied in detail. My research is dedicated to a better understanding of the ecology of microbial communities, which I believe is essential for developing and maintaining a sustainable society. To this end, I apply state-of-the art molecular ecology techniques (e.g. metagenomics and metatranscriptomics) to study microbial communities in detail. My research has mosly focused on the microbial ecology of Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems, motivated by the fast pace of the changes happening at high latitudes and how it affects the planet as a whole. Many ecosystems that are characteristic of polar regions such as sea ice and permafrost soils are disappearing at alarming rates.</p>

          <p>In both natural and agricultural soils, microorganisms represent the largest sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. The changes happening in permafrost are one example of regional disturbances with global impacts: the melting of permafrost will promote microbial activity likely resulting in the release of copious amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Our ability to model and predict these impacts is hampered by our limited knowledge of the microorganisms involved with the cycling of greenhouse gases in polar environments.</p>
