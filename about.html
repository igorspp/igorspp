<h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i>About me</h2>
<p>I am a microbiologist specialized in the molecular ecology of polar microbial communities. I have a MSc degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology from the <strong>Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul</strong> (UFRGS, Brazil), and a PhD in Sciences from the <strong>University of Liège</strong> (ULiège, Belgium). I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the <strong>University of Helsinki</strong> (UH, Finland). <!-- My main interests are... --></p>

<p>I have been fascinated with the Polar Regions since my undergraduate studies in Brazil. I was very surprised by how little we know about the microbial communities thriving in cold environments, especially if we acknowledge their vital contribution to global climate and biogeochemical cycles. I first had the chance to work with polar microbial ecology during my master’s studies. Under the supervision of Dr. Alexandre Macedo from the <a href="https://www.ufrgs.br/labdim/wordpress/inicio/inicio-en/" target="_blank">Laboratory of Biofilms and Microbial Diversity</a> (UFRGS, Brazil), I studied the functional and taxonomic diversity of microbial communities in soil, water and snow from King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula. After obtaining my MSc degree, I decided to continue my studies abroad. My PhD studies were carried out in the <a href="http://annuaire.ulg.ac.be/search.html?id=u014381" target="_blank">Cyanobacteria group</a> (ULiège, Belgium) under the supervision of Dr. Annick Wilmotte. My PhD focused on the study of the diversity and ecology of cyanobacteria in a range of Arctic and Antarctic environments.</p>

<p>I have now been working since 2018 as a post-doctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/molecular-environmental-biosciences/research/arctic-microbial-ecology" target="_blank">Arctic Microbial Ecology group</a> (UH, Finland) led by Dr. Jenni Hultman. Our research mainly focuses on the application of state-of-the art molecular ecology techniques (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics and single-cell sequencing) to the study of soil microbial communities in different Arctic environments. You can read more about our research <a href="/research">here</a>.</p>

<p>During my training as a polar microbial ecologist I have acquired experience with the isolation and characterization of fungi, bacteria and microalgae, as well as amplicon-sequencing and meta-omics analyses of Arctic and Antarctic microbial communities. I have also been involved in the supervision of several MSc and BSc students and in the teaching of undergraduate- and master-level microbiology and bioinformatics courses.</p>
